# Mastermind Game

This is a simple implementation of the Mastermind game in C. In this game, the player tries to guess a secret code generated by the computer. The secret code consists of a sequence of digits, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct code.

## How to Play

1. **Compile the Code**: Compile the provided C code using a C compiler. For example:

2. **Run the Game**: Execute the compiled binary to start the game. Optionally, you can provide command-line arguments to specify the secret code or the number of attempts. If no arguments are provided, a random secret code will be generated, and the default number of attempts is 10.

- `-c secret_code`: Optional. Specifies the secret code to be guessed by the player. If not provided, a random secret code will be generated.
- `-t attempts`: Optional. Specifies the number of attempts allowed for the player to guess the code. If not provided, the default is 10 attempts.

3. **Gameplay**: Once the game starts, the player will be prompted to enter a guess. Enter a sequence of 4 digits as your guess. After each guess, the game will provide feedback on the correctness of the guess.

4. **Feedback**: After each guess, the game will provide feedback in the form of the number of well-placed pieces (digits correctly placed) and the number of misplaced pieces (correct digits in the wrong position).

5. **Winning**: Keep guessing until you correctly guess the entire secret code. If you manage to guess the code within the specified number of attempts, you win the game!

## Additional Notes

- The game ends when the player correctly guesses the entire secret code or when the number of attempts runs out.
- The secret code is a sequence of 4 digits chosen from the digits 0-9.
- The game uses standard input/output for interaction with the player.
- Enjoy playing Mastermind!
